# Running Stateful workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service 
In this walkthrough, we will demonstrate how you can deploy a highly available Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using multiple availability zones. in this cluster we will deploy a highly available and distributed ElasticSearch cluster. we will also demonstrate how we can handle zone failures and how we can handle cluster upgrades. more sections will be added as time allows (such as backup and restore and monitoring)
